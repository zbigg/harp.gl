[[UriResolver]].\n *\n * Resolves `uris` basing on exact or prefix match of `key` from `definitions`.\n *\n * In definitions, `key` is matched against input uri with following strategy:\n *  - `key` without trailing `/` -> `key` and input `uri` must be identical\n *  - `key` with trailing `/`, -> `key` is treated as \"package prefix\", so `uri` must start with\n *    `key`\n *\n * Example:\n * ```\n * {\n *     \"local://poiMasterList\": \"/assets/poiMasterList.json\"\n *        // will match only 'local://poiMasterList' and resolve `/assets/poiMasterList.json`\n *     \"local://icons/\": \"/assets/icons/\"\n *        // will match only 'local://icons/ANYPATH' (and similar) and resolve to\n *        // `/assets/icons/ANYPATH\n * }\n * ```\n * Inspired by [`WICG` import maps

The number\n * of rows and columns in each level is 2 to the power of the level. This means: On level 0, only\n * one tile exists, [[columnsAtLevel]]() and [[rowsAtLevel]]() are both 1. On level 1, 4 tiles\n * exist, in 2 rows and 2 columns. On level 2 we have 16 tiles, in 4 rows and 4 columns. And so on.\n *\n * A tile key is usually created using [[fromRowColumnLevel]]() method.\n *\n * `TileKey` instances are immutable, all members return new instances of `TileKey` and do not\n * modify the original object.\n *\n * Utility functions like [[parent]](), [[changedLevelBy]](), and [[changedLevelTo]]() allow for\n * easy vertical navigation of the tree. The number of available rows and columns in the tile's\n * level is given with [[rowCount]]() and [[columnCount]]().\n *\n * Tile keys can be created from and converted into various alternative formats:\n *\n *  - [[toQuadKey]]() / [[fromQuadKey]]() - string representation 4-based\n *  - [[toHereTile]]() / [[fromHereTile]]() - string representation 10-based\n *  - [[mortonCode]]() / [[fromMortonCode]]() - number representation\n *\n * Note - as JavaScript's number type can hold 53 bits in its mantissa, only levels up to 26 can be\n * represented in the number representation returned by [[mortonCode]]().\n */\nexport class TileKey {\n    /**\n     * Creates a tile key.\n     *\n     * @param row The requested row.

size of integers on which\r\n// Javascript performs bit-operations.  For operations like addition and\r\n// multiplication, we split each number into 16 bit pieces, which can easily be\r\n// multiplied within Javascript's floating-point representation without overflow\r\n// or change in sign.\r\n//\r\n// In the algorithms below, we frequently reduce the negative case to the\r\n// positive case by negating the input(s) and then post-processing the result.\r\n// Note that we must ALWAYS check specially whether those values are MIN_VALUE\r\n// (-2^63) because -MIN_VALUE == MIN_VALUE (since 2^63 cannot be represented as\r\n// a positive number, it overflows back into a negative).  Not handling this\r\n// case would often result in infinite recursion.\r\n//\r\n// Common constant values ZERO, ONE, NEG_ONE, etc. are defined below the from*\r\n// methods on which they depend.\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * An indicator used to reliably determine if an object is a Long or not.\r\n * @type {boolean}\r\n * @const\r\n * @private\r\n */\r\nLong.prototype.__isLong__;\r\n\r\nObject.defineProperty(Long.prototype, \"__isLong__\", { value: true });\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @function\r\n * @param {*} obj Object\r\n * @returns {boolean}\r\n * @inner\r\n */\r\nfunction isLong(obj) {\r\n    return (obj && obj[\"__isLong__\"]) === true;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Tests if the specified object is a Long.\r\n * @function\r\n * @param {*} obj Object\r\n * @returns {boolean}\r\n */\r\nLong.isLong = isLong;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * A cache of the Long representations of small integer values.\r\n * @type {!Object}\r\n * @inner\r\n */\r\nvar INT_CACHE = {};\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * A cache of the Long representations of small unsigned integer values.\r\n * @type {!Object}\r\n * @inner\r\n */\r\nvar UINT_CACHE = {};\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @param {number} value\r\n * @param {boolean=} unsigned\r\n * @returns {!Long}\r\n * @inner\r\n */\r\nfunction fromInt(value, unsigned) {\r\n    var obj, cachedObj, cache;\r\n    if (unsigned) {\r\n        value >>>= 0;\r\n        if (cache = (0 <= value && value < 256)) {\r\n            cachedObj = UINT_CACHE[value];\r\n            if (cachedObj)\r\n                return cachedObj;\r\n        }\r\n        obj = fromBits(value, (value | 0) < 0 ? -1 : 0, true);\r\n        if (cache)\r\n            UINT_CACHE[value] = obj;\r\n        return obj;\r\n    } else {\r\n        value |= 0;\r\n        if (cache = (-128 <= value && value < 128)) {\r\n            cachedObj = INT_CACHE[value];\r\n            if (cachedObj)\r\n                return cachedObj;\r\n        }\r\n        obj = fromBits(value, value < 0 ? -1 : 0, false);\r\n        if (cache)\r\n            INT_CACHE[value] = obj;\r\n        return obj;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Returns a Long representing the given 32 bit integer value.\r\n * @function\r\n * @param {number} value The 32 bit integer in question\r\n * @param {boolean=} unsigned Whether unsigned or not, defaults to signed\r\n * @returns {!Long} The corresponding Long value\r\n */\r\nLong.fromInt = fromInt;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @param {number} value\r\n * @param {boolean=} unsigned\r\n * @returns {!Long}\r\n * @inner\r\n */\r\nfunction fromNumber(value, unsigned) {\r\n    if (isNaN(value))\r\n        return unsigned ?
