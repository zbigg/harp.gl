And so on.\n *\n * A tile key is usually created using [[fromRowColumnLevel]]() method.\n *\n * `TileKey` instances are immutable, all members return new instances of `TileKey` and do not\n * modify the original object.\n *\n * Utility functions like [[parent]](), [[changedLevelBy]](), and [[changedLevelTo]]() allow for\n * easy vertical navigation of the tree. The number of available rows and columns in the tile's\n * level is given with [[rowCount]]() and [[columnCount]]().\n *\n * Tile keys can be created from and converted into various alternative formats:\n *\n *  - [[toQuadKey]]() / [[fromQuadKey]]() - string representation 4-based\n *  - [[toHereTile]]() / [[fromHereTile]]() - string representation 10-based\n *  - [[mortonCode]]() / [[fromMortonCode]]() - number representation\n *\n * Note - as JavaScript's number type can hold 53 bits in its mantissa, only levels up to 26 can be\n * represented in the number representation returned by [[mortonCode]]().\n */\nexport class TileKey {\n    /**\n     * Creates a tile key.\n     *\n     * @param row The requested row.

MSAA stands for Multi Sampling Anti-Aliasing, and its concept\n * is to provide a rendering engine with additional color values for each pixel, so they can include\n * the missing bits between them on a screen. WebGL already comes with a native MSAA implementation\n * with four samples. Because of its native nature, it is more efficient and one may not want to use\n * MapView's MSAA implementation when these four samples are satisfying. However in some situations\n * they are not: on low devices, MSAA can impact the framerate and we may desire to reduce the\n * number of samples at runtime. On the other hand, when the interaction stops, the engine also\n * stops rendering the map, and because a map relies on many line-like patterns, aliasing can then\n * turn very noticeable.

doesn't copy _extra_ properties of `options` that doesn't exist in `defaults`.\n * `defaults` is used as _parameters_ template.\n *\n * This doc uses following notion of `option` and `parameter` terms:\n * * `parameter` is a variable, or 'almost constant' of procedure/function/algorith/object\n *    * `parameter` usually have sensible and usually used default\n *    * `parameter` is always defined (no `undefined`, `null` or `?` in type)\n *    * `parameter` can be overriden by specyfying `option` with same name\n * * `option` means value that may be passed optionally, overrides `parameter` value with same name\n *\n * Usage:\n *\n *     interface FooParams {\n *         useTextures: boolean;\n *         opacity: number;\n *     }\n *\n *     const FOO_DEFAULTS: FooParams =

params.someOtherOptionFromOtherApi is not defined\n *     }\n *     const opt = {opacity: 0.5, someOtherOptionFromOtherApi: 'aaa'};\n *     doSomething(opt);\n *\n * Rationale:\n *   * both
